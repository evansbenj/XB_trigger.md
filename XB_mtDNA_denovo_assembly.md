# Where are the lab XB from?

To try to address this, I used the WGS data to assemble complete mtDNA genomes using NOVOplasty.  This worked very well with the macaques.

The command on info is:
```
/4/ben/2017_SEAsian_macaques/NOVOPlasty/NOVOPlasty3.7.2.pl -c config.txt
```
in this directory for Dad (BJE3896) and Mom (BJE3897) XB respectively (from Furman and Evans 2018):
```
/2/scratch/ben/2018_Austin_XB_genome/Trimmed_reads/Reads_DAD
```
```
/2/scratch/ben/2018_Austin_XB_genome/Trimmed_reads/Reads_MOM
```
